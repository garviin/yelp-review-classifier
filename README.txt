Before running the jupyter notebook, please put these files in the same directory as the notebook:

- review_text_train_doc2vec50.csv
- review_text_train_doc2vec100.csv
- review_text_train_doc2vec200.csv
- review_text_test_doc2vec50.csv

To run each model, please open “ML Assignment 2.ipynb”, and run all cells. The results should be written in the same folder as the ipynb file.

If you encounter any issues, please contact me at gbulkin@student.unimelb.edu.au

NOTE: The stacked model was not used in the report, however I submitted it to kaggle, the code for it has been kept for proof that it was my own work.
